// a new process is created by calling fork
// fork dupl;icates current process qwith all attributes
// exe cplus fork is all you need to create a process
// pid_t fork(voiid);
//call to the fork in the parent process gives pid of a new child process
// fork in the parent returns pid 1, whereas
// to the child it returns 0;
FORK DUPLICATES THE PROCESS INSIDE THE COMPUTER.
NOW INSIDE THE PARENT PID IS 1
AND IN CHILD PID 0 RETURNED BY THE FORK.

if fork fails it returns -1
child_max is rthe limit of no of child processes the parent might have
fork syntax:
pid_t new1;
new1=fork();

GETPPID RETURNS THE PID OF PARWENT PROCESWS
